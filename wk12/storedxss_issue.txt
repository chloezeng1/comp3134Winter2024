The primary issue with the storexss.php script is that it reads data from storedxss.txt and outputs it directly to the browser without any sanitization or encoding. This behavior allows for stored XSS attacks, where malicious scripts stored in the text file are executed in the browser of anyone who accesses the PHP page. This can lead to a variety of security risks, including session hijacking, phishing, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
