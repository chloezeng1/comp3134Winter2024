In the web application development process, it's common to include comments in the source code to explain the code's functionality, 
note the authorship, or mark areas for future improvement. 
However, when these comments are left in the HTML code, they become visible to anyone who views the source of the web page. 
This visibility can lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive information such as internal notes, developer identities, 
or even hints about potential vulnerabilities in the application.
To address this issue, we have converted HTML comments into PHP comments in the comments_in_source_code_part2.php script. 
PHP comments are processed on the server side and are not sent to the client's browser, making them invisible in the page's source view. 
This change ensures that any commentary intended for developers or system maintainers does not get exposed to the public or potential attackers.
