Stripping tags with strip_tags removes HTML and PHP tags from the user input,
 preventing those tags from being executed as part of the HTML or PHP on the
 page.

Encoding to HTML entities with htmlspecialchars converts special characters to
 their HTML-encoded equivalents. This makes the browser render them as plain
 text, thus preventing the execution of potentially harmful scripts.
