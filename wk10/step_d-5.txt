1. What I see on the browser?
The browser displays warnings indicating that scandir() failed to open the specified directory, 
which suggests that the input from the query string (q) is being directly used in filesystem operations without proper validation or sanitization.
The warnings also expose part of the server's file path (/var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php), 
which can provide an attacker with information about the server's directory structure.

2. What sensitive information is given by this page?
Server Path Disclosure: The warnings reveal the full path to the script (/var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php), 
which is sensitive information as it tells an attacker where the web root is located on the server.
Potential Directory Traversal: If the correct traversal syntax is used (like ../../), an attacker could potentially list and access files and directories outside of the web root, 
leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files or information.
