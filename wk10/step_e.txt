1.Mitigate Directory Traversal:
Use basename() to get the base name of the provided path, preventing access to the parent directories.
Concatenate the base name with the predefined root directory path to ensure the traversal is restricted within the specified root.
Ensure Directory Exists:
Before accessing the directory, check if it exists and is a directory using file_exists() and is_dir() functions.
Bonus - Prevent File Access:
A check can be added to ensure the query parameter is a directory name and not a file. 
This can be done by examining if there's a dot in the name, which typically signifies a file rather than a directory.
